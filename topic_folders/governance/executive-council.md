## The Carpentries Executive Council

### Introduction

The Carpentries Executive Council is the highest leadership body of The Carpentries, to whom the Executive Director of 
the Carpentries reports. The Council comprises nine members - four elected by the community and five appointed by the Executive Council. 

The Executive Council is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the Council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organisation’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of quarterly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms. For the full description of the Executive Council’s roles and responsibilities, see the Executive Council section of the [Carpentries Bylaws](bylaws.html#executive-council). 

In addition to [publicly posting meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/main/minutes), the Executive Council reports on its activities periodically in [Carpentries Clippings](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/) (the organisational newsletter) as well as through [blog posts](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-governance).
The Council also prepares [Yearly Summaries](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/main/year-in-review) of its activities.

### Executive Council Officers

Executive Council officers are selected at the first regular meeting following election and appointment of new members and serve one year terms. Officer positions include:

* Chair
* Vice Chair
* Secretary
* Treasurer

Roles and responsibilities for Executive Council Officers are described in the [bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#officers).

### Executive Council Standing Committees
As of January 2021, the following standing committee structure was implemented as a practical way to manage the work and engagement of the Executive Council:

- [Officers Committee](#officers-committee)
- [Governance Committee](#governance-committee)
- [Finance Committee](#finance-committee)
- [Program Committee](#program-committee)

Serving on a specific standing committee provides Executive Council members with the opportunity to bring their subject matter expertise to specific governance and operational priorities, deal with issues and projects more effectively and efficiently, and maximize time and resources between meetings. Each Executive Council member serves on at least one, but no more than two committees. When considered beneficial or necessary, these committees can have members from The Carpentries community and/or Core Team.

In addition to the Standing committees, the Executive Council may appoint ad hoc committees to handle issues that are typically short-term and specialised in nature.
